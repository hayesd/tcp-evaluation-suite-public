Introduction
============

This implementation of the TCP evaluation suite in NS2 is incomplete and has a
number of short comings and areas for further work. This file itself is a work
in progress, and will be updated as the implementation is tested.



Tests with an incomplete implementation
=======================================

Goodput:

  Currently the tmix based tests do not record the quantity of unique inorder
  data received at the receivers. This requires changes to the tmix code to
  provide this information. Instead the link throughput is used. Although this
  does not include dropped packets, it does include ACKs and any duplicate
  packets. This quantity is of particular interest in the "Impact on Standard
  TCP tests"



Tests yet to be Implemented
==========================

- Transients
- Intra-protocol and inter-RTT fairness
