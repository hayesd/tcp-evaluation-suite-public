Dependencies:
=============

The TCP Evaluation Suite is designed to run with NS version
2.35. There is a minor change to the the official 2.35 release, so it
is recommended that you use the version co-located in the repository
with the TCP evaluation suite.


Traffic trace files:
====================

The following trace files are required: r4s1.orig, r4s2.orig,
r4s3.orig, r5s1.orig, r5s2.orig, r5s3.orig, r6s1.orig, r6s2.orig,
r6s3.orig.

They are available from:
http://hosting.riteproject.eu/tcpevaltmixtraces.tgz, and need to be
placed in the scenarios/Tmix_Traffic directory.


Usage Instructions:
===================

Running eval/eval_tcp.sh without parameters will provide usage
instructions. Note that the "findtarget" option is not for general
use, but was used to determine the Tmix scale parameters defined for
the different experiments.


Adding a TCP variant:
=====================

TCP variants can be added by editing the eval/tcl/tcp_schemes.tcl file,
following the examples already there.

In addition to this a file with necessary test parameters needs to be placed in
each of the test directories:
  eg   eval/scenarios/Basic_Dumbbell_Scenarios/access_link/NewReno.tcl

Since the defaults have already been defined in tcl_base_setup for that
experiment, often the only line needed in the file is:

	    set Test_TCP NewTCPvariant

where "NewTCPvariant" identifies the scheme you have placed in
eval/tcl/tcp_schemes.tcl.


Implemented Tests:
==================

- Basic Dumbbell Scenarios:
	access_link
	data_center
	dial_up
	geo_satellite
	trans_oceanic
	wireless_access

	Delay ThroughputTradeoff (here in ns2 implementation)

- Impact on Standard TCP

- Ramp Up Time

- Multiple Bottleneck:
	Three bottlenecks with four flows
